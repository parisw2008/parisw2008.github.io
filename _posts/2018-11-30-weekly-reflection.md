this week we took our first midterm test for computer science. i didnt do very well, i belive i only got 6 questions out of 29 correct. today we observed a test packet and chose a question to eplain. i chose question two. the question was "what is the name of the outermost funcion in (scale 2 (circle do "solid" "blue") ?". the answer is scale because it is the first function used right after the second parenthesis, meaning it will be the one further out from other variables and functions. the second most answered question is b. people may have chosen this answer because circle is right after the second parenthesis. the person may have ignored the placement of the parenthesis. the first parenthesis is always the outer most.

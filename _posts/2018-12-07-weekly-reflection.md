this week we were working on our flag collage. my flag was the sweden flag. the dimensions of the flag is 5:2:9 horizontally and 4:2:4 vertically. i didnt think making a collage could so confusing and annoying. i had to read alot about the flag and i had to find the right colors for the flag. but i do know now that next time i will make sure i get my materials first. though class was annoying this week , it was still really chill and quiet. i look forward to creating my  flag through a program next week.

INtroduction to computer science is a great class. I really enjoy doing work on the computers. I cant wait to see what we do this year! I finally learned the proccess of making a website and how confusing it could be so far. My biggest problem that i have faced so far is adjusting to using technology. The only technology i use frequently is my phone, so using computers a lot has been quite troublesome.

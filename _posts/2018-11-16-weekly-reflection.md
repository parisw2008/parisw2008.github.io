This week we used wescheme. We learned about contracts and defining variables. For example we used the define feature to define a variable, that variable being my age. I would write ```(define gt(triangle 10 "solid" "green")``` on the right side of wescheme and it would say the same in the left. I would then have to type gt on the left side of wescheme for the shape to appear. the contract is the general description of what order a example should use its function number and strings in. The actual example is what you would write in order to recieve a definiton of your example.
